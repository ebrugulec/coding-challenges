# Coding Challenges

I have recently started to think about algorithm problems more and tried to solve them to improve my programming skills and these are my solutions to some of them that I found interesting and fun to solve.

1. [Majority Element](https://github.com/ebrugulec/coding-challenges/tree/master/Majority%20Element)
2. [Add Two Numbers](https://github.com/ebrugulec/coding-challenges/tree/master/Add%20Two%20Numbers)

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, feel free to reach out to me.


Happy coding!
