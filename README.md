# Coding Challenges

I have recently started to think about algorithm problems more and tried to solve them to improve my programming skills and these are my solutions to some of them that I found interesting and fun to solve.

The idea here is to try to gain a different point of view, challenge myself in thinking about efficiency more and give the new approaches a try.

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, feel free to reach out to me.

Happy coding!
